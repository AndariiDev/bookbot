# bookbot

BookBot is my second [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!


This program takes an input of a path of a readable text file and parses the information into the terminal.

It counts the number of words and how many times any given letter has come up, with some pretty formatting!



## Usage:
In the directory of the script:

python main.py /path_to_book
